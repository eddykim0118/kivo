Recommended Next Steps
1. Backend
[ ] Modularize API endpoints (move logic from main.py to api/routes.py).
[ ] Add authentication middleware (Supabase JWT validation).
[ ] Add more endpoints for job status, results, and user management.
[ ] Add error handling and logging improvements.
2. Frontend
[ ] Connect all API endpoints (upload, job status, results).
[ ] Implement job status polling and results dashboard.
[ ] Add authentication UI (Supabase Auth).
[ ] Add error boundaries and toast notifications.
3. Testing & CI/CD
[ ] Add unit and integration tests for backend and frontend.
[ ] Set up GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and deployment.
4. Deployment
[ ] Finalize Dockerfiles for production.
[ ] Write Terraform or CloudFormation for AWS infra (ECS, S3, etc.).
[ ] Set up environment variables for staging/production.
5. Documentation
[ ] Expand README with setup, deployment, and developer onboarding.
[ ] Add API docs (FastAPI auto-docs, OpenAPI).
